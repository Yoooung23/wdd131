			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>I'm going to build a tool to help generate yoga flow ideas for my wife's business.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Any yoga instructor, but mostly my wife</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>This site will first ask for criteria data from the user. Using that form data, such as how long you want the yoga session to go, and how advanced of a practice it will be, we'll have our javascript load objects from my object array of yoga poses and criteria, then sort them, and deliver a generasted yoga flow using the object details.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Flow</a>
			</nav>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>This page will have a introduction and description of what the page is used for. but then it will hava a button that says: "Generate!" that will take you to page 2</p>
			<h3>Flow</h3>
			<p>This is going to be a minimalist design, lots of space for page elements to breath. but there will be a generate button, and filter buttons. then when you have a generated flow, it will be displayed as a card with a image, a title, and small details, just enough of what you need for building a flow</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				this is where the user will land when they first come to the site. And they will get the introduction with the prompting to test out the generator. The included images are a mobile friendly perspective.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Wirefreame 1.png" alt="home page wireframe" style="width: 300px; height: auto;"/>

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
                This is where the user will be taken after they click the "Generate!" button. Then they can proceed to try the generator as much as they like. The included images are a mobile friendly perspective.
